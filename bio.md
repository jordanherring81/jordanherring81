## Life
---
My life started out in and around Seattle, Washington. My father is a carpenter by trade and has developed his own business now as a full on general contractor. My mother is a school teacher for ages three through five. I have two sisters and three brothers. Each of my brothers are currently in the Marine Corps or have previously served. My sisers are currently going to school. One is aiming to be a teacher and the other is hoping to become a nurse. Me and the wife got married five years ago and moved all over the world for the Marine Corps
