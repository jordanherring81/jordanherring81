There are many different things to think aout when chosing a barrel for your gun. The twist rate is a huge factor when it comes to accuracy and precision. with a long twist rate it will handle lighter rounds a but over  longer distances you lose accuracy. length goes hand and hand with twist rate and needs to be considered when your diciding your twist rate and rounds that are desired to be used. The metal also can greatly impact your rounds when it comes to follow on shots. Stainless steel is used primarly due to the fact that it causes less friction with the bullet but other forms of steel are used including 4150 and 4140 grades of steal. "
